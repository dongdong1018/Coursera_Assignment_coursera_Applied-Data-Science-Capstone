In order to find a balance between cheaper rental price and more convenient living facilities, we have to know the rental cost of each district. The link below provides the rental price of apartment with differece sizes. In this project, we only consider the average rental price (AVERAGE/M²). However, the algorithm used in this project also can be applied to small (<50 M²)/medium (50-129 M²)/large (>130M²) apartments. https://www.virtualvienna.net/moving-to-vienna/accommodation/real-estate-rental-prices/\n",
